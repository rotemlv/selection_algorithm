# selection_algorithm
** for some reason this climbed up the SEO, if you are looking for a good implementation, it's not here **
A python implementation of the selection algorithm based on median of medians, and a deterministic nlogn quicksort.

If you see anything wrong or unnecessary in this implementation, please let me know.
